Its presence indicates that the water used by the majority of the population is contaminated with sewage.\nEvery year, thousands of people from across the country, especially during the monsoon season, get infected with water-borne diseases—dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis A and E, and cholera. Most drinking water sources are contaminated with rainwater. Even bottled water, which is considered safe for drinking, has in the past been found to be contaminated with pathogenic microbes.\nThe report shows that 98.2 percent of the population use an improved source of drinking water.\n“The report shows almost everyone drinks water from an improved source, yet over 60 percent of drinking water samples were contaminated with deadly microbes. This means, the so-called improved sources have yet to be improved,” said an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “Agencies concerned should work to improve drinking water sources.”\nAmong household members in the country, 92.4 percent were found to be using improved sanitation facilities. Of these, 79.9 percent of household members were using improved toilets exclusively.\nLikewise, 86.4 percent of households were found to have a designated handwashing place equipped with water and soap or other cleansing agents.\nThe study examined multiple issues, including child mortality, nutrition, adolescent fertility, family planning, teenage pregnancy, smoking, education, maternal and neonatal health, drinking water and sanitation, protection and discrimination, mental health, mobile phone use, access to electricity, and other social sector concerns.\nAccording to the report, seventeen newborns in every 1,000 die before reaching one month, 27 before reaching one year of age, and 31 die before reaching five years of age.\nThe national-level study was conducted by the National Statistics Office (NSO) in partnership with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), as part of the Global MICS Programme. Technical and financial support for the survey was provided by UNICEF, with additional funding from the government.\nData were collected across the country by selecting 540 clusters—304 from urban areas, and 236 from rural areas. Information was collected from 12,960 households, according to the report.\nMICS surveys measure key indicators that enable countries to generate data for use in policies, programmes, and national development plans, and to monitor progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other internationally agreed-upon commitments.", "url": "https://kathmandupost.com/health/2026/02/09/over-60-percent-of-nepal-s-households-use-sewage-contaminated-water-report", "scraped_at": "2026-02-11T08:41:28.534803"}

The two-day event brings together political leaders, policymakers, intellectuals, and Gen Z activists from Nepal and abroad to debate contemporary challenges and explore solutions for the country’s future.\nKantipur Media Group (KMG) Chairman Kailash Sirohiya opened the two-day conclave, where he framed the event as a platform for informed public dialogue at a time of political and economic uncertainty.\nSirohiya said a conscious society is built on accurate information, debate and dialogue. He stressed the need for sustained public engagement amid growing political and economic uncertainty.\nHe said KMG has consistently promoted platforms for discussion on issues of national importance alongside its daily journalism.\n“The distinctive feature of the Kantipur Conclave is that it brings national, regional and international concerns together on a single platform, with Nepal at the centre. We believe there must be an inclusive public debate on shared concerns. Reaching the fifth edition [of the conclave] reflects continuity, trust, participation and collaboration.”\nSirohiya said Nepal has long faced political instability, weak institutions, a crisis of trust, and economic pressures. At the same time, new public awareness has also been emerging, he added.\n“Recent protests, dissatisfaction and civic voices are raising fresh questions for the state and political leadership about their direction, method and leadership,” he said.\nHe noted that questions are being asked across society, from villages to cities, young people to senior citizens, and from the streets to digital platforms, but meaningful answers remain absent. Rhetoric, slogans and attractive promises alone cannot address citizens’ aspirations.\n“What Nepal needs today is a calm, fact-based, honest and outcome-oriented national dialogue,” Sirohiya said. “Our commitment is to make the Kantipur Conclave a meaningful platform for that purpose.”\nHe said the conclave is not merely a formal conference but a national initiative aimed at steering the country from uncertainty towards clarity and collective solutions. The forum will host open discussions on politics, governance, the economy, federal implementation, the impact of information and algorithms, changing forms of citizen voice, and regional and international geopolitics.\nDemocracy and dissent\nNobel Peace Prize winner and human rights activist Ebadi, delivering the keynote address, highlighted the challenges of upholding democracy and protecting human rights in countries governed by rigid ideologies.\nFocusing on Iran, her home country, Ebadi said citizens have protested for democratic freedoms and women’s rights for more than four decades, often facing arrests, suppression and violence.\n“In Iran, laws are based on the religion chosen by the state, rather than reflecting the will of the people,” she said, stressing that governments should not prioritise ideology over citizens’ rights and voices.", "url": "https://kathmandupost.com/national/2026/02/10/kantipur-conclave-opens-with-shirin-ebadi-lauding-gen-z-revolt", "scraped_at": "2026-02-11T08:41:28.961134"}
{"title": "Karki commission gets third term extension", "tag": "National", "content": "The government has once again extended the term of the commission formed to probe the killings and devastation of the September 8 and 9 Gen Z movement. This is the third time the commission’s term has been extended.\nA Cabinet meeting on Monday decided to extend the term of the commission led by Gauri Bahadur Karki that is probing the two-day uprising that saw 77 people killed. The commission’s deadline has been extended by another 25 days, said Home Minister Om Prakash Aryal, also the government spokesperson.\nWith this extension, the commission’s report is now expected to be released only after the elections on March 5 elections.\nThe commission has been investigating the KP Sharma Oli-led government’s deadly crackdown on the anti-corruption protests on September 8 and the widespread destruction of public and private property on September 9. Commission officials say they are currently busy writing the report and need some more time to finalise it.\nThe findings and recommendations of the Gauri Bahadur Karki-led commission are considered crucial.\nLeaders from the old parties warn that if the report is released before the elections and it implicates leaders who are contesting, it could influence the electoral process. As the election code of conduct is already in effect, the Election Commission also has the authority to advise the government on the matter.\nOn Monday, the Karki commission requested the government for the term extension.\nSpeaking to the Post, a minister said that if the commission submitted its report, the government would be forced to make it public. “And that could be detrimental to the March election,” the minister told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “To avoid any kind of friction ahead of the election, we decided to extend the term and mandate of the commission.”\nThe Karki-led commission recently completed recording statements of key officials who were in office during the crackdown: former prime minister KP Sharma Oli; former home minister Ramesh Lekhak; former chief secretary Eknarayan Aryal; then home secretary Gokarna Mani Dawadi; and then chief district officer of Kathmandu, Chhabi Rijal.\nStatements were also recorded from other leaders, including former Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba; Nepali Communist Party’s coordinator Pushpa Kamal Dahal; and former Kathmandu Metropolitan City mayor Balendra Shah.\nFrom the security agencies, statements were recorded from then inspector general of Nepal Police, Chandra Kuber Khapung; current inspector general Dan Bahadur Karki; Armed Police Force Inspector General Raju Aryal; Nepali Army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel; and then head of the National Investigation Department, Hutaraj Thapa.\nThere is big public interest in the commission’s findings, as the two-day crackdown and violence eventually claimed 77 lives and caused property damage worth billions of rupees.\nEarlier, on January 22, the Cabinet had extended the commission’s term by 20 days. Now the commission has received another 25 days, which, apparently, will be enough to prepare the report.\nMeanwhile, there is confusion over whether Karki will submit the report to the present government or hand it over to the new one which might take some more time to be formed after the election.\nSince several high-profile leaders were called to record their statements, implicating any of them ahead of the elections might pose a serious security threat, said an official at the prime minister’s office.\nThe official said several leaders, particularly from the CPN-UML and the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), have shown interest in the report’s content.\nCPN-UML chief Oli was the prime minister during the Gen Z movement in September. The commission also recorded statements from RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane and Balendra Shah, who resigned as mayor last month and joined the RSP to contest the elections.\nLamichhane faces allegations related to jailbreak from Nakhhu prison on September 8, while Shah, who was the mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City at the time, has been criticised for his conduct during the Gen Z protests.\nThe government formed the commission on September 21. Initially given a three-month timeframe, the commission was later granted an additional 20 days. Originally, the commission was tasked with investigating human and material losses during the protests; analysing the causes of the incidents; submitting findings and recommendations; collecting information on damage; proposing measures to prevent a recurrence; and preparing an action plan to implement its recommendations.\nThe commission’s mandate was expanded following a 10-point agreement between Gen Z representatives and the government on November 30.", "url": "https://kathmandupost.com/national/2026/02/10/karki-commission-gets-third-term-extension", "scraped_at": "2026-02-11T08:41:29.397524"}
{"title": "Political rivals watch Baburam Bhattarai’s next move in Gorkha-2", "tag": "National", "content": "Gorkha Constituency 2 has remained one of the country’s most closely watched electoral constituencies in every election since the first Constituent Assembly polls in 2008. The upcoming House of Representatives election has once again drawn national attention with the candidacy registration and subsequent withdrawal of former prime minister Baburam Bhattarai, who served as second-in-command of the 1996-2006 Maoist insurgency. The poll result is wide open as rival parties are closely watching which of his party, the Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party (PLP) will ultimately support.\nThirteen candidates, including two independents, are contesting for the snap parliamentary elections scheduled for March 5. Yet, more than the candidates themselves, local discussions continue to revolve around Bhattarai’s political legacy and the possible direction of his support base. While activists from the Rashtriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and Nepali Communist Party (NCP) [which is led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the leader of the Maoist insurgency] have claimed on social media that Bhattarai’s backing may favour their candidates, the PLP itself has not announced any formal decision, making its stance a key factor in determining the election winner.\nAfter the April uprising in 2006, Gorkha-2 has largely been dominated by Bhattarai and candidates aligned with the then Maoist movement. The constituency gained national prominence again in 2022 when then CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairman Dahal contested and won the seat with 26,101votes, defeating RSP’s Kabindra Burlakoti who secured 12,636 votes. Earlier, in 2017, Bhattarai had won from the same constituency, defeating senior Maoist leader Narayan Kaji Shrestha in a high-profile contest.\nWith neither Bhattarai, Dahal nor Shrestha in the election fray this time, the contest appears wide open. The NCP has fielded young leader Lekhnath Neupane, who emerged from student politics and is contesting his first parliamentary election. The Nepali Congress has nominated social worker-turned-politician Prakash Chandra Dawadi, while the RSP has once again fielded its general secretary, Burlakoti. The CPN-UML has nominated gangster Milan Gurung, known as Chakre Milan. Other candidates represent fringe parties, including the Aam Janata Party, CPN (Maoist), Mongol National Organisation, Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, Ujyalo Nepal Party and National Republic Nepal.\nLocal voters say the shifting loyalties of party cadres have made the poll predictions quite difficult. “Former Maoist supporters and even Congress activists seem to have moved towards newer parties, especially the RSP. When the cadres from rival parties begin changing sides, it becomes hard to say which candidate is stronger. Older parties cannot assume that their traditional vote banks will remain intact this time,” said Shiva Shrestha of Palungtar.\nAccording to election officials, Gorkha-2 has a total 108,533 registered voters, an increase of more than 3,000 compared to the 2022 election. The constituency includes wards 8 to 14 of Gorkha Municipality, Palungtar Municipality and Siranchok, Ajirkot and Barpak Sulikot rural municipalities. For the upcoming polls, 94 polling stations and 150 polling centres have been set up.\nHistorically, the constituency has delivered decisive mandates. In the 2008 Constituent Assembly election, Bhattarai secured 83 percent of the total votes cast, winning by a margin of around 40,000 votes, one of the largest margins recorded nationwide. Bhattarai contested the second Constituent Assembly election from Gorkha-1 and emerged victorious, while Maoist candidate Hitaraj Pandey was  elected from Gorkha-2.\nBhattarai later split from the Maoists and formed the Naya Shakti Party and contested the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2. He defeated the Maoist senior leader Narayankaji Shrestha by around 3,000 margins.\nThe candidates of major political parties remain confident about their prospects. The NCP leaders argue that the constituency’s left-leaning voter base will favour their candidate. NCP leader Parashuram Ramtel claimed that Neupane’s long involvement in student politics and his clean image have strengthened his appeal among voters. “Gorkha-2 has always been politically aware, and voters tend to choose ideological clarity,” he said.\nRSP candidate Burlakoti has his own claim. He believes the national mood for change is working in his favour. He said public expectations for political reform align with his party’s agenda. “People want change, and we entered politics with that promise. The growing organisational strength compared to the last election is our biggest advantage,” he said.\nNepali Congress leaders also express confidence, arguing that this election has energised party workers because they are campaigning under their own election symbol after years of poll alliances with other parties. District secretary Kishor Jung Thapa said that since 2013, Congress supporters in Gorkha-2 had largely voted for alliance candidates. “This time, our supporters feel ownership of the campaign. The candidate selection process was smooth, and that has added enthusiasm,” he said.\nDespite competing claims, attention remains fixed on Bhattarai’s next move. After withdrawing his candidacy, Bhattarai said he chose to remain above electoral competition and play a broader advisory role rather than become merely a member of parliament. His decision has left supporters divided but has heightened speculation about where his influence may ultimately flow.\nThe PLP has formed a political dialogue committee under district coordinator Yan Prasad Bhatta to decide whether to support any candidate in the direct election. At the same time, the party has been mobilising voters to seek proportional representation votes under its own banner. In Palungtar alone, three ward chairs are close to Bhattarai, reinforcing perceptions that his legacy continues.\nFor now, Gorkha-2 remains a constituency defined by uncertainty. With traditional alliances weakened, new political forces emerging, and the PLP yet to declare its position, local voters say the election is more competitive than in the past.", "url": "https://kathmandupost.com/national/2026/02/09/political-rivals-watch-baburam-bhattarai-s-next-move-in-gorkha-constituency-2", "scraped_at": "2026-02-11T08:41:29.829956"}
{"title": "How confident is Nepal’s business community after the Gen Z uprising?", "tag": "Money", "content": "Nepal’s private sector is looking to the next government for reassurance after the September Gen Z uprising dealt a major blow to business confidence, further unsettling an already fragile investment climate.\nJust as the economy was showing early signs of recovery from the Covid shock—after years of political volatility and a recessionary phase—the protest movement emerged as another setback. Businesses, the country’s largest employers, say the unrest froze investment decisions and deepened uncertainty.\nThe contradiction in the economy is stark. Nepal’s foreign exchange reserves climbed to a record Rs3.20 trillion by mid-December 2025—more than half of the country’s gross domestic product—highlighting an unusual situation of excess liquidity alongside weak growth, sluggish investment and rising unemployment.\nEconomists say the reserves now far exceed Nepal’s actual financing needs. Rather than signalling economic strength, the surge has been driven largely by rising remittance inflows as young Nepalis continue to leave the country, while domestic consumption and private investment remain subdued.\n“This is a recession-like situation—full reserves but no investment,” economists say, noting that such conditions typically reflect political instability and eroding private-sector confidence.\nBusiness leaders sounded the alarm during the sixth session,Rebuilding the Economy, Restoring Confidence, at the Kantipur Conclave, Kantipur Media Group’s flagship event. They urged policymakers to recognise the private sector as the primary engine of growth and job creation.\nChandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the private sector tends to be the first casualty in every protest. He blamed the destruction of businesses and private property during the Gen Z movement on the infiltration of vested interests.\n“This kind of violent activity did not happen in previous movements,” Dhakal said. “It has created fear across the private sector. Although most businesses have reopened, many will take time to recover.”", "url": "https://kathmandupost.com/money/2026/02/09/how-confident-is-nepal-s-business-community-after-the-gen-z-uprising", "scraped_at": "2026-02-11T08:41:30.273385"}
